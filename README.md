# Where am I

This is a list of the projects that I am currently working on under the Where What brand:

## What is my elevation?

This was the site that I built that first gained an audience, and entirely just because the domain name resonated so well with people.

## [How fast am I going?](https://whatismyelevation.com/how-fast-am-i-going)

This was my second addition, originally at its own site but now listed under what is my elevation.

This site also speaks for itself, simply giving you your device reading for speed, along with direction.

## [What is my location?](https://whatismyelevation.com/what-is-my-address)

To answer this question, I built what is my address. This site also has subpages to help you find what your country is, what your county is, what your zipcode is, what your neighborhood is, and even what your school district is.

This site can give you details about any address or location that you search for.

Some possible use cases:
- You need to find the neighborhood of a real estate listing
- You need to find your city for tax purposes

## [What city am I in?](https://whatismyelevation.com/what-is-my-city)

This site can find your city based on your current location. You can also search for an address to find the city it is in.

Some possible use cases:
- You need to confirm the city of a real estate listing
- You need to find your city for tax purposes
- You need to find out what jurisdiction you are under
